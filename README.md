# FUND-MANAGEMENT-LAYER
Fund Management Layer, a revolutionary new modular primitive for Capital Markets of the Future , designed with cryptographic primitives, designed for algorithms, humans and AGI 

# Fund Management Layer (FML) Protocol

## Transforming Capital Markets Infrastructure

FML Protocol eliminates 99% of traditional fund setup costs and reduces deployment time from 18 months to 18 minutes through cryptographic innovation and blockchain integration.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **⚡ Instant Deployment**: Launch compliant funds in under 20 minutes
- **🌍 Global Compliance**: Automated regulatory compliance across jurisdictions
- **💰 Cost Reduction**: From $2M to $200 setup cost
- **🔄 Built-in Liquidity**: Automated market making for instant redemptions
- **🔐 Cryptographic Security**: Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving compliance
